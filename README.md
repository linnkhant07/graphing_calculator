# Graphing Calculator

## Introduction

The Graphing Calculator allows users to input mathematical expressions and generate corresponding graphs. With essential features like zooming, scrolling, and a history bar, it provides a smooth experience for exploring mathematical concepts. Additionally, the application stores previous functions in a text file for easy access and recall across sessions.
## Features

- **Graph Visualization:** Input mathematical functions and visualize their graphs.
- **Zoom and Scroll:** Zoom in/out and scroll around the graph for detailed analysis.
- **History Bar:** Easily access and select previous functions from the history bar.
- **Function Persistence:** Store functions in a text file for easy retrieval across sessions.

## Technologies Used

Our graphing calculator leverages a variety of technologies to provide its functionality:

- **RPN (Reverse Polish Notation):** Used for parsing mathematical expressions efficiently.
- **Shunting Yard Algorithm:** Converts infix expressions to postfix notation, facilitating evaluation.
- **SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library):** Provides the graphical user interface for drawing graphs.
- **Arrays, Linked Lists, Stack, Queue:** Data structures used for managing history and processing expressions.
- **Tokenizer:** Splits input expressions into tokens for parsing and evaluation.
